## Project Migration Notice

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a new Android Studio/IDEA project template, and then open the project in the corresponding IDE.

This method is not very elegant and requires the software to be installed on the user's computer.

Later, I plan to merge this project into the IDEA plugin and integrate it into the new project template function.

In this way, you can use IDEA to install the plugin to create projects directly using this template, and it is more flexible and scalable.

After the new project is determined, a link to the new project will be added here.

At that time, I will terminate the maintenance of this project and recommend that everyone move to the new project.

## What's this

This is an automatic building tool for Xposed Modules using [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/HighCapable/YuKiHookAPI) as the core.

Implementing automated search relies on quickly building an Android project template that includes a Xposed Module environment.

## How to use

This project is developed using **Electron** to quickly build and run multi-platform localized applications.

You can download the application for your platform directly
